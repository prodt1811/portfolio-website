In my free time, I learned basic HTML, CSS and a touch of JS which i used to make this website.</span>

                <h2>Course</h2>
                <pre>
                    When I came over for the NYP open house,
                    I learned many things about this course and 
                    how its better than the same courses offered
                    at the diffrent polys. For example, NYP offers
                    more choices for its students to intern at in 
                    year 3. I hope I can come here to further 
                    my education with NYP

                <h2>The Environment</h2>
                <pre>
                    For me, since I live close to serangoon mrt, NYP
                    offers the shortest commute time from my home to 
                    any of the polytechnics in Singapore. Not only that,
                    NYP's campus is small, which makes it easier to 
                    navigate and harder to get lost in compared to 
                    polytechnics like NP and SP.

                <h2>Lecturers and Students</h2>
                <pre>
                    When I came to NYP, I was greeted warmly by all the
                    lecturers and students here! As compared to other schools,
                    NYP's lecturers and students were more keen on sharing 
                    about their courses to me and my friends. I hope I can come
                    to NYP so I'm able to develop such a nice character like them!
