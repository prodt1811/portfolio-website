                    <pre id = "words">
In my spare time, I like to play
board games such as chess and 
weiqi. In HIHS, I'm my school's 
Chinese Weiqi club vice-chairman.
I've participated in various 
competitions from 2022-2024 like 
29th Qiuping cup, the first weiqi 
competition I attended. I enjoy 
these games for the brain teasers 
as well as the challenge of facing
a new opponent each day and having 
to overcome the new playing styles

I'm currently taking Computing in school. 
As a computing student, I like
the work and projects I'm given 
as I find making them an exciting
challenge to see howshort of a code 
I can make. In my free time, I learned 
basic HTML, CSS and a touch of
JS which i used to make this website.

                    <pre id = "words">
Apart from playing board games, over the 
weekends I also like to
go out cyling. Sometimes i go 
cycling with my friends, but 
often times I go alone. Some 
places I have cycled to from my 
home in seranggon is Punggol park, 
the first place I cycled to, Marina 
Bay Sands, Pasir Ris park and also . 
I staerted cyling in Primary 5 after 
my father basically dragged me out of 
the house. But since then, I have 
continued to go out on my own to cycle
to further and further places.

                <pre>
                    When I came over for the NYP open house,
                    I learned many things about this course and 
                    how its better than the same courses offered
                    at the diffrent polys. For example, NYP offers
                    more choices for its students to intern at in 
                    year 3. I hope I can come here to further 
                    my education with NYP

                <h2>The Environment</h2>
                <pre>
                    For me, since I live close to serangoon mrt, NYP
                    offers the shortest commute time from my home to 
                    any of the polytechnics in Singapore. Not only that,
                    NYP's campus is small, which makes it easier to 
                    navigate and harder to get lost in compared to 
                    polytechnics like NP and SP.

                <h2>Lecturers and Students</h2>
                <pre>
                    When I came to NYP, I was greeted warmly by all the
                    lecturers and students here! As compared to other schools,
                    NYP's lecturers and students were more keen on sharing 
                    about their courses to me and my friends. I hope I can come
                    to NYP so I'm able to develop such a nice character like them!
